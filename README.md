# LSCD
## The full Lewis Sanders Computing Device (LSCD) repository, containing designs, assemblers, and emulators.

The **LSCD** computers are a series of homebrew computer architectures, usually 8 or 16 bit, including but not limited to:

- **LSCD11** : The LSCD11 was the first LSCD computer. Design on this computer began in fall of 2023, and was completed and solidified near the first half of 2024. The LSCD11 has two registers: the accumulator, and the return register. It has a unusual 11 bit RAM and program memory address width (over 2KB of data.) Additionally, instructions are split into two parts: the opcode (there are 16 opcodes) and the operand(memory adress, immediate value), with 1 or 4 unused bits in an instruction.

( that design, now refered to as the LSCD11A, was updated soon after in the LSCD11B, with some much needed changes.)
